<p align='justify'>
TOPAZ has been actively in use by t<a href='https://sites.google.com/site/atcgalerna/'>galerna project</a> from the <a href='http://www.unican.es'>University of Cantabria</a>. For this reason, as well as offering the infrastructure inherited from SICOSYS, we also offer many of the code generated in the last few years, in the shape of router architectures, traffic generation improvements, or additional capabilities such as event counting for energy analysis purposes.<br>
